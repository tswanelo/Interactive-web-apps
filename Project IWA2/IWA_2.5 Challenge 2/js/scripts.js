// Questions


/* Why did the original code not work?

// Because I was supposed to remove the semicolons and insert a comma between user and surname.

What changes did you need to make to achieve the intended behaviour?

// In the comments i've just corrected the closing comments then in the  console.log i have removed the semicolons then inserted a comma.

Why did the change result in the intended behaviour?

// Is because without these changes the codes would not work that way.

Are there any other ways in which it could have been solved?*/

// Yes, if maybe I can divide the user and surname in the other console.log it will still work.
